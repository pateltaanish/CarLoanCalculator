I was bored and was shopping for cars. And saw how much I would be paying for financing, 
but I wanted to know how much I would be paying in intrest over my finace term. So I wrote this quick program. 
It takes in your credit score and calculates your APR for the item price after you put in your down payment to 
show you every monthly payent, intrest, and principle. 
Great! 
Now I know how much money i'm actually spending :)
